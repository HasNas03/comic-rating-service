**Comic Catalog Project**

- The Comic Catalog is a personal project aiming to develop a custom application for storing comic book reviews and reading progress
- The project is also a gateway for me to learn and practice backend development (with Java & Spring Boot), REST APIs, cross-miroservice creation/communication, testing, security, and external database integration

**Technologies**
- Core technologies used: Java, Spring (Boot, WebMVC), Maven
- Future technologies: (SQL/MongoDB and/or SpringJPA)
